title: Leap Gesture Mapper

Are you lazy? Don't be shy, we are too!
When we heard about the leap the first thing to enter our minds was 'couch control'.

# Get lazy!

We wanted to be able to control our music with the flick of a wrist. We wanted to be able to browse by lifting as little fingers as possible. We wanted to be able to poke our Facebook friends by *poking* them.

We wanted to be able to make whatever happen by doing whatever.

# Versatility through simplicity

The Leap Gesture Mapper is very simple in its essence.
You define a gesture and then say what should happen if you make that motion.

No more, no less.

To get you started, we've pre-defined a few gestures but apart from that, you're totally on your own.
We get it, some people like having total control over everything that happens on their computers. We're like that too.
That's why the gesture mapper is perfect for us, and that's why it will be perfect for you.
